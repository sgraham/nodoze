nodoze
------

Sort of like `caffeinate' on OS X. Runs a subcommand and prevents the computer
from sleeping while it's running.

Doesn't support any options or command line flags, everything after its name is
the subcommand.


Build
-----

From a vsvarsall.bat shell (i.e. with compiler in the path):

  C:\...\nodoze>m.bat


Example
-------

  C:\proj\stuff>nodoze my_long_running_command --something
  ...
  <computer doesn't sleep>
